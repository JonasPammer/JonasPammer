    description_full: |
      Discord is the ultimate cross-platform community chat application for text,
      video, and voice communication, with a whopping 250+ million users worldwide.
      It's like the best of Skype and TeamSpeak³ combined,
      but without any cost and available on every platform,
      and dozens of other brand-new features.
      Everyone can create his own community server, totally for free with a lot of
      settings, permissions, groups, bots, and much more.

      .Disclaimer
      [NOTE]
      However, it's essential to keep in mind that while Discord is an excellent communication tool,
      it may not be the most secure chatting application out there.
      It's important to treat every message and chat with caution,
      knowing that anyone could potentially screenshot and read it.
      So, be mindful of the content you share and who you communicate with on the platform.

      *Most awesome Skyblock-Idea of all time which i fell in love with*:
      *** Concept: Nearly each block in the game has a "material-value". Using
      a magic table or chest, you can transform your farmed items into this
      value, store it, and also exchange it back into items that match your
      gathered value.
      *** You can build automated farms to harvest the value and exchange them
      into the items you want (e.G: Tubes for Item-Transport, Redstone that
      can stick to side of blocks, Block-Breakers, "Solar-like Panels" which
      turn sun-energy into the material-value, and much more...)
