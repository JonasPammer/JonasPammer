This got me started on my private pc-setup script back in 2022-03-02


## Usage

Every script is required to be run in a powershell window.
If admin rights are required, the respective script elevates itself.

The following command is required to run anything that follows:

[source,powershell]
----
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force
----

### Git-free install

[source,powershell]
----
Invoke-Expression ((New-Object net.webclient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JonasPammer/JonasPammer/master/provisioner-windows/bootstrap.ps1'))
----

### Scripts

#### Install/Update Apps and Configure PC (automatic)

[WARNING]
May restart the computer.

[source,powershell]
----
 ./pc-setup.ps1
----

#### Fix potential windows problems (automatic)

[NOTE]
Restarting the computer afterwards is recommended and necessary for it do fully do its job.

[source,powershell]
----
 ./pc-repair.ps1
