This got me started on my private pc-setup script back in 2022-03-02

[NOTE]
If admin rights are required, the respective script tries to spawn a new elevated powershell process (with the originally executed command and preseved current working directory). This is done for convenience, so you can _just_ execute the script.

## Git-free install using Powershell script

Installs chocolatey,
installs git using chocolatey,
git checkout's this repository to `$USERPROFILE\Documents\Programmieren\JonasPammer\JonasPammer` and
cd's to this (sub)folder (containing the scripts).

[source,powershell]
----
Invoke-Expression ((New-Object net.webclient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JonasPammer/JonasPammer/master/provisioner-windows/bootstrap.ps1'))
----

## Command required to use Scripts

The following command is required to run powershell scripts:

[source,powershell]
----
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force
----

## Script: PC Setup

[WARNING]
May restart the computer.

[source,powershell]
----
./pc-setup.ps1
----

This will:

1. Install and update applications.yml,
2. setup powershell profile,
3. configure git,
4. run antivirus,
5. install wsl (if enabled)

This script aims to be fully automated and not ask anything.

### Second, Semi-Automatic part

[source,powershell]
----
./pc-setup-other.ps1
----

This will:

1. Setup GPG using 1Password (if enabled)

## Script: PC Repair

Fixes potential windows problems (automatic)

[source,powershell]
----
 ./pc-repair.ps1
----

[NOTE]
Restarting the computer afterwards is recommended and necessary for it do fully do its job.
