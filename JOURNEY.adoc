== Minecraft
It all started with my fondness and enthusiasm for the computer game Minecraft,
which I played on a Mac Mini in the living room from the moment the browser preview was released.
It was to be the only game I played for a very long time and I still have a strong connection with it. +
I was very intrigued by the update which introduced https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Command_Block[Command Blocks].
I started watching Videos of people making tutorials on interesting concepts that can be implemented using these Command Blocks,
up to the point of recreating games and making fun parkour / story maps.
// I also loved SkyBlock and Mods that added Technical Stuff.

I got my first own PC - of course with the primary purpose being for ~Minecraft~ School.
I installed Windows 10 on it and watched Videos and read diverse Materials Internet on using it.

I started watching videos that showed how to create software that could add/change the functionality of Minecraft servers using Java and Eclipse.
I bought an aaS Minecraft Server.
I had plans on creating a Minecraft Server Network with some Friends, where everything was programmed by me.
My hopes and plans were obviously too high, but I kept going anyway.
I joined some other Servers as a co-developer of Minigames or a Builder of Maps.

I soon bought a VPS running GNU/Linux Debian on which I installed and managed my Server(s) myself -
it was more cost effective and learning new stuff is always fun.
SSH, PuTTY, screen, FileZilla, IP, DNS, ..? All very intriguing

A big step that got me into programming and understanding things was creating dozens of Minecraft hack clients.
The first ones were just blank copies of videos from Youtube,
but the last ones were big rewrites of rewrites that contained my own frameworks, systems, menus, functions and mods
into which I put hours of debugging -even if it was all done to a poor standard and no real programming/design pattern knowledge.

== It's 2017.
I knew that my overall interest in IT was very strong, and I wanted to continue doing what I was doing
because I enjoyed it and it was all so fascinatingly logical.
I knew I wanted to be a Software Engineer (or similiar) and thus **study** Informatics. +
But I also knew that my basic knowledge of some things was only based on a few crappy YouTube videos
and that this dream would require a lot of concentration and effort.
// Note though that my school was very ground level as far as education goes
// (not even things like log/sin/cos/e were teached. the best it got was like function theorem).

I decided to do an additional voluntary year in a school that focuses on
helping young people get an education in form of apprenticeship in one year.
I got a taste of many professions, learned the basics of electrical engineering and job applications.

**I bought a https://www.udemy.com/course/cpp-bootcamp[CPP Bootcamp Videocourse Series on Udemy*]**,
**which was one of the best investments of my life.**
I re-learned Java through a Book on it and a Dive into Design Patterns
(We're still talking about self-taught Java without any real applications here, to remind you).
I joined a small Arduino course which got me to apply and show-off my knowledge and help others.
I had an online friend (which later went on to study Mathematics) which I was able to ask to help explain to me many intriguing questions I had while I was digging through my C++ course which helped me a lot.

== It's 2018-2022
I managed to show-off on the internship trial day at one of the last companies still looking for apprenticeships for that year.

Although I arrived at the vocational school 3 months late,
I managed to grasp and understand even challenging topics in a short time.
The best thing about this small company I joined was that I was given all the time in the world to learn.

As for the programming side of IT:
I bought a book about HTML/CSS/JS.
I bought a book about Linux.
I read lots of articles and best practices.
I bought a Server/DNS at Hetzner and later OVH.
I installed many things on it.
I got to embrace OSS.

I planned, developed, managed and deployed various company-internal applications from the ground up all by myself.
The first was a proof-of-concept app for booking meals
(probably to test if I really have the knowledge and spirit of a full stack'er)
and one of the last being a freight cost tracker
as well as a tool for validating server racks.
I also introduced many new things to the company,
such as an actually maintained and useful wiki
and a revised network documentation and monitoring.

I was interested in everything, constantly asking friends at school
what they were doing and interested in how big companies make things happen.

So, that was it. My path to IT.
Everything after it is Career.
