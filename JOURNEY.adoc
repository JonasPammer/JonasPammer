== Minecraft
It all started with my fondness and enthusiasm for the computer game Minecraft, 
which I played on a Mac Mini in the living room from the moment the browser preview was released.
It was to be the only game I played for a very long time and I still have a strong connection with it. +
I was very intrigued by the update which introduced https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Command_Block[Command Blocks].
I started watching Videos of people making tutorials on interesting concepts that can be implemented using these Command Blocks,
up to the point of recreating games and making fun parkour / story maps.
// I also loved SkyBlock and Mods that added Technical Stuff.

I got my first own PC - of course with the primary purpose being for ~Minecraft~ School.
I installed Windows 10 on it and watched Videos and read diverse Materials Internet on using it.

I started watching videos that showed how to create software that could add/change the functionality of Minecraft servers using Java and Eclipse.
I bought an aaS Minecraft Server. 
I had plans on creating a Minecraft Server Network with some Friends, where everything was programmed by me.
My hopes and plans were obviously too high, but I kept going anyway.
I joined some other Servers as a co-developer of Minigames or a Builder of Maps.

I soon bought a VPS running GNU/Linux Debian on which I installed and managed my Server(s) myself -
it was more cost effective and learning new stuff is always fun.
SSH, PuTTY, screen, FileZilla, IP, DNS, ..? All very intriguing

I made dozens of Minecraft Hack Clients - the first ones being blank copies of Videos from youtube, 
and the lasts ones being big rewrites of rewrites implementing my own frameworks, systems, menus, functionality and mods.

== It's 2017. 
I knew that my overall interest in IT was very strong, and I wanted to continue doing what I was doing 
because I enjoyed it and it was all so fascinatingly logical. 
I knew I wanted to be a Software Engineer (or similiar) and thus **study** Informatics. +
But I also knew that my basic knowledge of some things was only based on a few crappy YouTube videos 
and that this dream would require a lot of concentration and effort.
To add salt to Injury I also didn't have good grades because I literally neglected all my homework, 
even though I was one of the best students in the class (especially in math and English / except for Geography or History ;) ).

I decided to do an additional voluntary year in a school that focuses on 
helping young people get an education in form of apprenticeship in one year.
I got a taste of many professions, learned the basics of electrical engineering and job applications.

#I bought a https://www.udemy.com/course/cpp-bootcamp[C++ Bootcamp Videocourse Series on Udemy],#
#which was one of the best investments of my life.#
I re-learned Java through a Book on it and a Dive into Design Patterns 
(We're still talking about self-taught Java without any real applications here, to remind you).
I joined a small Arduino course which got me to apply and show-off [;)] my knowledge.

== It's 2018
My people skills were low, my expressions in writing snooty 
and my appearance anything but appealing, which I can still fully confirm today.
Although I was initially rejected by all offers, +
I managed to show-off on the internship trial day at one of the last companies still looking for apprenticeships for that year.

Although I arrived at the vocational school 3 months late, 
I managed to grasp and understand even challenging topics in a short time.
The best thing about this small company I joined was that I was given all the time in the world to learn.

As for the programming side of IT:
I bought a book about HTML/CSS/JS.
I bought a book about Linux.
I read lots of articles and best practices.
I bought a Server/DNS at Hetzner and later OVH.
I installed many things on it.
I got to embrace OSS.

I planned, developed, managed and deployed various company-internal applications from the ground up all by myself.
The first was a proof-of-concept app for booking meals 
(probably to test if I really have the knowledge and spirit of a full stack'er)
and one of the last being a freight cost tracker or a tool for validating server racks.
I also introduced many new things to the company, such as an actually maintained and useful wiki 
and a revised network documentation and monitoring. 

I was interested in everything, constantly asking friends at school what they were doing
and was interested in what and how big companies make things happen.

So, that was it. My path to IT.
Everything after it is Career.
