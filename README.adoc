== My Interest in IT

* I don't limit myself to knowing only part of it. +
  I'm interested in programming, Linux, and the whole DevOps automation cycle,
  but I also cherish an good understanding of IT infrastructures and network protocols/network communications.
+
I also could talk for hours about my enthusiasm for Web Development, especially about the concepts of the Browser and its accompanying protocols/specifications and the prospects they still offer and continue to enable us today.
__Strong Men may look into the source code of this README document to find some words of mine on this.__
// At the end of the day the browser is like a JRE, and HTML/CSS/JS/HTTP/... are the Specifications for it's JVM -
// just with the fact that a "program" (website) "runs it's code" as a second class citizen,
// and the primary "application code" is just structued text (HTML) that is being rendered by the some Engine. +
// (You can hang me for this comparison if you want but it's true).

* ðŸŒ± Having just completed an IT apprenticeship, I am currently studying for various networking certifications to solidify _and prove_ my knowledge / know that I could definitely own it (if i let go of my imposter complex).

* ðŸŒ± I'm currently heavily diving into the topics of *IaaC* with Ansible/Terraform/Amazon Web Services and **C**ontinious Automated **I**ntegration/**D**elivery with GitHub Actions and Docker.
+
These are very fascinating topics that are fundamentally changing the way software development and deployment is done.
Servers / VMs are transformed from sacred "don't touch" black box systems into simple disposable and on-demand createable goods.
It is the pinnacle of automation and reproducibility.
+
And the crazy thing is that nothing has fundamentally changed -
It's just that the solutions (Linux, SSH, HTTP, TLS, ..) and concepts (TCP/IP, ..) that were created a long time ago by very smart people are so crazily thought-of princibles
which we're all just slowly sticking together and extending continously. IT is amazing.

.Footnote on GitHub
____
I use GitHub as my primary version control and collaboration platform.

I also sync my projects to a privately hosted GitLab instance.
I do this mainly for archival purposes (GitHub is owned by Microsoft),
but also to just try things out of course.

Do note that I am currently in the process of refactoring every of my projects
and also try to figure out new development schemes
now that I'm fairly confident in the knowledge i posses
