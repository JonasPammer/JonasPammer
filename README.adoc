= üëã Hey there. My name's Jonas

I like to get behind the concept of something and understand what it's _actually_ for - 
I see myself more of as a Concept guy, hence the plan and dream to get a master in informatics / computer science. +
I like to embrace Documentation and Conventions.

== Foot notes

I also sync my projects to a privately hosted GitLab instance. 
I do this mainly for archival purposes (GitHub is owned by Microsoft), 
but also to just try things out of course.

Do note that I am currently in the process of refactoring every of my projects
and also try to figure out new development schemes 
now that I'm fairly confident in the knowledge i posses
