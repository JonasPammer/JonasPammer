https://roadmap.sh/backend[Dev] https://roadmap.sh/infrastructure[Ops] - the modern take on "Full Stack Developer" - is a very fascinating topic 
that is fundamentally changing the way software development and deployment is https://landscape.cncf.io/[done].
Servers and virtual machines are no longer seen as untouchable black boxes, but as implicitly documented, disposable on-demand creations.
It's truly the pinnacle of automation and reproducibility!

And the crazy thing is that **nothing has fundamentally changed** -
It's just that The solutions like Linux, SSH, HTTP, TLS, TCP/IP, and more were created by brilliant minds long ago, and they're so ingeniously designed
that we're still continue to stick them together in order to build the next big thing. IT is amazing.
