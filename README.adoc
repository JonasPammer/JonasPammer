= üëã Hey there. My name's Jonas

== About Me

I know my way around Linux, IT and Programming.

I like to get behind the concept of things (*Software is not magic*)
// in fact, nothing is magic. it's all just concepts
and understand what they're _actually_ for before discussing anything or using them.
There's so much [aaS] software and platforms popping up with magic words
that don't delineate what part of the problem they actually solve
nor do they say what they _actually_ (most-often-then-not "just") do
these days, which is really frustrating at first.
I like Software that does one thing very awesomely.

I like to place a high value on adherence to
http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s06.html[conventions],
documentation, and structured problem analyzation.
__In other words__, I https://www.stilldrinking.org/programming-sucks[thankfully] can and do still live in and with this dream world mindset.__
// because of my lack in experience working on more real projects with more real people in a more real/defined field ;).

üì∫ Favourite Series::
Avatar: The Last Airbender, Star Trek (VOY / TNG / PICARD / DISCOVERY)

‚õ≥ Hobbies and Interests::

== My Interest in IT

* I don't limit myself to knowing only part of it. +
  I'm interested in programming, Linux, and the whole DevOps automation cycle,
  but I also cherish an good understanding of IT infrastructures and network protocols/network parts and design.
+
I also could talk for hours about my enthusiasm for Web Development, especially about the concepts of the Browser and its accompanying protocols/specifications and the prospects they still offer and continue to enable us today.
// At the end of the day the browser is like a JRE, and HTML/CSS/JS/HTTP/... are the Specifications for it's JVM -
// just with the fact that a "program" (website) "runs it's code" as a second class citizen,
// and the primary "application code" is just structued text (HTML) that is being rendered by the some Engine. +
// (You can hang me for this comparison if you want but it's true).
+
I started with Java and Linux server administration, did several C++ projects with Arduino, moved from simple web development to modern web development and now mainly use and fell in love with Python for all-the-things surrounding programming.

// NOTE: The following sentence is to be kept in sync with my LinkedIn Info
* üå± Having just completed an IT apprenticeship, I am currently studying for various networking certifications to solidify, prove and deepen my knowledge.

// NOTE: The following sentence is to be kept in sync with my LinkedIn Info
* üå± I'm currently heavily diving into the topics of *IaaC* with Ansible/Terraform/Amazon Web Services and **C**ontinious Automated **I**ntegration/**D**elivery with GitHub Actions and Docker.
+
These are very fascinating topics that are fundamentally changing the way software development and deployment is
https://landscape.cncf.io/[done].
Servers / VMs are transformed from sacred "don't touch" black box systems into simple disposable and on-demand createable goods.
It is the pinnacle of automation and reproducibility.
+
And the crazy thing is that nothing has fundamentally changed -
It's just that the solutions (Linux, SSH, HTTP, TLS, ..) and concepts (TCP/IP, ..) that were created a long time ago by very smart people are so crazily thought-of princibles
which we're all just slowly sticking together and extending continously. IT is amazing.

.Footnote on GitHub
____
I use GitHub as my primary version control and collaboration platform.

I also sync my projects to a privately hosted GitLab instance.
I do this mainly for archival purposes (GitHub is owned by Microsoft),
but also to just try things out of course.

Do note that I am currently in the process of refactoring every of my projects
and also try to figure out new development schemes
now that I'm fairly confident in the knowledge i posses
