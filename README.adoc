== Foot notes

I also sync my projects to a privately hosted GitLab instance. I do this
mainly for archival purposes (GitHub is owned by Microsoft), as well as
trying things out as we plan to move to GitLab in our company.

Do note that I am currently in the process of refactoring every of my projects
and also try to figure out new development schemes now that I'm fairly confident
in the knowledge i posses thanks to my last years of apprenticeshipment and enthusiasmnism.
