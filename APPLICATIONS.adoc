|
Intel's "Extreme Tuning Utility" lets you tune, overview and
benchmark like every parameter a cpu can possibly have
(And it isn't software-level-configuration. It is configuring
the cpu parameters itself - so they stay until a system-crash
(like BSOD) occurs and resets them to their defaults).
I mostly use it for undervolting Laptop CPU's
and to check if a CPU is Power-Throtteling.

| https://downloadcenter.intel.com/de/download/28425/Intel-Driver-Support-Assistant[Intel DSA]

** https://rodrigo-al.jimdo.com/texture-packs/8x8-rodrigo-s-pack/[Rodrigo's

stuff

Similar to FTB-Lite, but without magic
** https://www.technicpack.net/modpack/tekkit.552560[Tekkit-Classic] -
*Most awesome Skyblock-Idea of all time which i fell in love with*:
*** Concept: Nearly each block in the game has a "material-value". Using
a magic table or chest, you can transform your farmed items into this
value, store it, and also exchange it back into items that match your
gathered value.
*** You can build automated farms to harvest the value and exchange them
into the items you want (e.G: Tubes for Item-Transport, Redstone that
can stick to side of blocks, Block-Breakers, "Solar-like Panels" which
turn sun-energy into the material-value, and much more...)
*** The Modpack includes a big amount of Mods from Tekkit-Lite with
energy but also adds lots of magic (e.G: A ring that lets you fly freely
at the cost of the mentioned material-value)
*** Onliest Problem: Old Minecraft Version (1.2.5)

| Program | Usage

| https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.calendar&hl=de[*Google Calendar*]
|
Cross-Platform and simple to use Calendar - available for every OS (even a Web-App),
simply integrateable in any App using
https://developers.google.com/calendar/[Google's Calendar API]

| https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.maps&hl=de[*Google Maps*]
|
Cross-Platform and simple to use Map - available for every OS (even a Web-App),
simply integrateable in any App using
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/?hl=de[Google's Maps API].
Emphasizing Features / What I like about it:

* It contains almost every facility - each with detailed, quick
accesable information (e.G: opening hours, at which time there will
likely be many people, the Website linked with the Facility, is it
Wheelchair accessible, how much does the hotel cost, etc.)
* Every user can contribute to the map by adding Information about
certain Facilitys at a certain location, or even "create" a new facility
* Every user can contribute by commiting a review of a certain facility
using a "0 to 5 Stars" Rating System with attachable (360* or normal)
Images.
* Traffic Jam gets shown when driving. _(Either it is being calculated
using the anonymously shared background-Information from other devices
or Google Maps is being informed by local news or other drivers
directly?)_
* Active Building Sites as well as the ability to choose between Highway
or not Highway are included when calculating the perfect route.
* You can save Streets/Facilitys, give them a special labels (e.G.
"Home", "Work" or "Best Friend") and categories (e.G. "Favored", "Want
to visit")
* The whole UI is minimalistic and materialistic. Anyone can use it -
even if you just want to know "What's the opening Time for ****" - you
can just google the exact sentence you would ask a stranger and google
fetches you the answer using the data collected by google maps
* Programmers like me can simply integrate a "Map-View" showing a
certain building in our App or even Website
* You can choose between different views (Even a View from the Satelite
- almost like in https://www.google.com/intl/de/earth/[Google Earth], or
Terrain-Highlighting View)
* Mosts Places can be "visited/viewed as if you stand there" using
captured 360* Camera-Footage from either Google or even normal user
uploads (So called [https://maps-satellit.com/ Google Street View])
* You can see where you were in the past
