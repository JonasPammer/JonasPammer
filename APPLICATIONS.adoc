| Program | Usage
| https://discordapp.com/[*Discord*]
|
Discord is the ultimate cross-platform community chat application for text,
video, and voice communication, with a whopping 250+ million users worldwide.
It's like the best of Skype and TeamSpeak³ combined,
but without any cost and available on every platform,
and dozens of other brand-new features.
Everyone can create his own community server, totally for free with a lot of
settings, permissions, groups, bots, and much more.

.Disclaimer
[NOTE]
However, it's essential to keep in mind that while Discord is an excellent communication tool,
it may not be the most secure chatting application out there.
It's important to treat every message and chat with caution,
knowing that anyone could potentially screenshot and read it.
So, be mindful of the content you share and who you communicate with on the platform.

Device (e.g. FortiWifi-30D) that has a USB-AB Port.
It's a standalone Application that also installs some brand-own drivers.
It was discontinued in 2016 but is still available for download on their
Support Website (Login needed).

*Most awesome Skyblock-Idea of all time which i fell in love with*:
*** Concept: Nearly each block in the game has a "material-value". Using
a magic table or chest, you can transform your farmed items into this
value, store it, and also exchange it back into items that match your
gathered value.
*** You can build automated farms to harvest the value and exchange them
into the items you want (e.G: Tubes for Item-Transport, Redstone that
can stick to side of blocks, Block-Breakers, "Solar-like Panels" which
turn sun-energy into the material-value, and much more...)
*** The Modpack includes a big amount of Mods from Tekkit-Lite with
energy but also adds lots of magic (e.G: A ring that lets you fly freely
at the cost of the mentioned material-value)
*** Old Minecraft Version (1.2.5) Vibes hard

Peek makes it easy to create short screencasts of a screen area.
It was built for the specific use case of recording screen areas, e.g. for
easily showing UI features of your own apps or for showing a bug in bug reports.
With Peek, you simply place the Peek window over the area you
want to record and press "Record". Peek is optimized for generating
animated GIFs, but you can also directly record to WebM or MP4 if you prefer.
