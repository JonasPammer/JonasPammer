settings, permissions, groups, bots, and much more.).

Peek makes it easy to create short screencasts of a screen area.
It was built for the specific use case of recording screen areas, e.g. for
easily showing UI features of your own apps or for showing a bug in bug reports.
With Peek, you simply place the Peek window over the area you
want to record and press "Record". Peek is optimized for generating
animated GIFs, but you can also directly record to WebM or MP4 if you prefer.

Only works with Linux in combination with X11
(Wayland support might be added. it got lots of stars and is open source).

why something (doesnt) work), etc...

| https://downloadcenter.intel.com/de/download/24075/Intel-Extreme-Tuning-Utility-Intel-XTU-[Intel XTU]
|
Intel's "Extreme Tuning Utility" lets you tune, overview and
benchmark like every parameter a cpu can possibly have
(And it isn't software-level-configuration. It is configuring
the cpu parameters itself - so they stay until a system-crash
(like BSOD) occurs and resets them to their defaults).
I mostly use it for undervolting Laptop CPU's
and to check if a CPU is Power-Throtteling.

| https://downloadcenter.intel.com/de/download/28425/Intel-Driver-Support-Assistant[Intel DSA]

Intel's "Driver Support Assistent" finds the newest Drivers of

trusted to be one of the best Inspection Program for Hard Drives,
which is why I have it installed.)

*My favourite game of all time.*

* Clients
** ...
* Recource-Packs:
** https://resourcepack.net/oerlis-realistic-photo-pro-resource-pack/[
Oerlis Realistic Photo Pro x256] - mostly used in context with the below
mentioned shaders for that awesome realistic feel from time to time
** https://rodrigo-al.jimdo.com/texture-packs/8x8-rodrigo-s-pack/[
Rodrigo's Pack] - for the sweet and awesome minimalistic look
** (Before 2018 I mostly/always used
https://bdcraft.net/["Spaxh" BDCraft] for _everything ;)_.)
* Shaders
** http://shadersmods.com/sildurs-shaders-mod/[Sildurs Vibrant Shaders]
* Mod-Packs
** https://www.feed-the-beast.com/projects/ftb-lite[FTB-Lite] - Good old
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItOTriUJIaM&list=PL2CkP1Bfxjsv8PqTWLpnm48afT32Z_1sf[#MegaProjekt]-Times,
hottests Modpack for me with a lot of technology / energy and even magic stuff
** https://www.technicpack.net/modpack/tekkitlite.552675[Tekkit Lite] -
Similar to FTB-Lite, but without magic
** https://www.technicpack.net/modpack/tekkit.552560[Tekkit-Classic] -
*Most awesome Skyblock-Idea of all time which i fell in love with*:
*** Concept: Nearly each block in the game has a "material-value". Using
a magic table or chest, you can transform your farmed items into this
value, store it, and also exchange it back into items that match your
gathered value.
*** You can build automated farms to harvest the value and exchange them
into the items you want (e.G: Tubes for Item-Transport, Redstone that
can stick to side of blocks, Block-Breakers, "Solar-like Panels" which
turn sun-energy into the material-value, and much more...)
*** The Modpack includes a big amount of Mods from Tekkit-Lite with
energy but also adds lots of magic (e.G: A ring that lets you fly freely
at the cost of the mentioned material-value)
*** Onliest Problem: Old Minecraft Version (1.2.5)
