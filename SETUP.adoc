PC (not pictured)::
Got rid of Gaming Laptop - was a bad idea i will never recommend to anyone. Battery life is miserable and heat is a problem.
My model had its chassis bent because of the battery right after warranty voided, causing me to spend 140€ for a replacement from official support (pictured above, black OLED RTX 3090 model. Initial one was a Mercury White RTX 2070). +
Now got a normal 1000€~ Tower PC again (32GB RAM, RTX 3070),
inspired by https://www.hardwaredealz.com/bester-gaming-pc-fuer-unter-1000-euro-gamer-pc-bis-1000-euro[this config].
__self-configured and bought as a tested- and built package (to avoid troubles) at https://www.dubaro.de__

Bose QuietComfort 35 Noise Cancelling Headset::

Dell R620::
I used to have a Root Server over at Hetzner and then OVH for years,
then I noticed I've spent wayyyyyy to much money and got my own.
It's the same one i used for
https://short.jonaspammer.at/schoolproject[my IT school project].
Very quiet.

I still have my E-Mail Server on OVH though because
I want my E-Mails to just work (be trusted / delivered)
and not care about configuration / maintenance of it.

Also have my DNS at OVH for automatic setup of email mx records.
Though, 2025 I switched the actual DNS zone to Cloudflare,
so i have an extra layer of speed with the added benefit
of Analytics and one-click DDoS protection (for free).
If Cloudflare would be a registrar for NIC.at, i would use it directly.
