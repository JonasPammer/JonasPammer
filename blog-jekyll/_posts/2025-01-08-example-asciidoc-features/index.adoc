== Code Blocks

All code blocks have a copy button (📋) that appears in the top-right corner. Click it to copy the code to your clipboard!

.Bash
[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash
# Start development server
cd blog

hugo server --buildDrafts
----

.Console Commands (Smart Copy)
[source,console]
----
$ cd my-project
$ npm install
$ npm run build
----

NOTE: Console blocks automatically strip the `$` prompt when you copy, joining commands with `&&` for easy pasting.

.Python
[source,python,linenums]
----
def fibonacci(n):
    """Generate Fibonacci sequence up to n terms."""
    a, b = 0, 1
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        result.append(a)
        a, b = b, a + b
    return result

# Example usage
print(fibonacci(10))
----

.JavaScript
[source,javascript]
----
// FlexSearch configuration
const index = new FlexSearch.Document({
  document: {
    id: "url",
    index: ["title", "content", "tags"],
    store: ["title", "url", "date"]
  },
  tokenize: "forward"
});

// Add documents
data.forEach(doc => index.add(doc));

.Example with Placeholder (No Copy Button)

----
# Configuration with sensitive data
export API_KEY="your-secret-api-key-here"  # pragma: allowlist secret

TIP: Add `role="nocopy"` to a code block to disable the copy button for blocks containing placeholders or sensitive examples.
